# Verilog Simulation Tools & Concepts

## 1. Icarus Verilog (`iverilog`)

**What is it?**

It is an open-source compiler for the Verilog hardware description language (HDL).

**What does it do?**

It takes your human-readable Verilog source code (`.v` files) and "compiles" them. Unlike a C compiler that creates machine code for your CPU, `iverilog` creates a structural representation of your digital circuit (netlist) and wraps it into a simulation executable (often with a `.vvp` extension).

## 2. vvp (Icarus Verilog Runtime)

**What is it?**

It is the simulation runtime engine (Virtual Machine) that comes with Icarus Verilog.

**What does it do?**

It executes the compiled output file generated by `iverilog`. It simulates the passage of time, propagates signals through logic gates, and executes `initial` and `always` blocks.

## 3. VCD (Value Change Dump)

**What is it?**

It is a standard ASCII-based file format for dumping simulation history.

**What does it do?**

During simulation, `vvp` records every time a signal (wire or register) changes its value (0 -> 1, 1 -> 0, etc.) and the timestamp of that change.

**Usage** 

You open this file with a waveform viewer (like **GTKWave** or **Surfer**) to visually inspect how signals behave over time. It's your "oscilloscope" for digital logic.

## 4. Hex File (`.hex`)

**What is it?**

A simple text file containing hexadecimal numbers.

**What does it do?**

In Verilog simulations, it is commonly used to initialize memory modules (like RAM or ROM). The system task `$readmemh("file.hex", memory_array)` reads this file and loads the values into the simulated memory array.
**Usage:** In CPU design, this file acts as the "binary executable" of the software you want the CPU to run. It contains the machine code instructions.
